# D3-Project
I did this for extra practice after taking a d3 intro class

This was a extra project I challenged myself to after completing a course on
JavaScript D3.  I graphs crime statistics for all 50 states from 2014 to 2017. 
The .csv file I created out of the data that I collected from different sources.
They can be found on the page or in the html.
